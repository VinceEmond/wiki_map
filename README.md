# About

Wiki Map is an an app that facilitates the creation of maps containing data points collected from a collaboration of many users. This app really shines when it's used to build maps containing location points that are typially not easily found or searchable on typical map search engines. For example:

For example: "Best Places to Eat Around Town" or "Locations of Movie Scenes". This was a built as a midterm project during the Lighthouse Labs Web Dev Bootcamp to practice HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery AJAX and PostgreSQL and most importantly to practice the GIT version control workflow involved team projects.

## Major Learnings:
1. Planned and built an ERD, user stories and routes
2. Wrote CSS style sheets from the ground-up
3. Utilized both jQuery and AJAX
4. Implemented Google's map API
5.

## Notable Features
* Ability to browse a list of publicly available maps created by others
* Registered users can create their own maps and contribute pins to other maps
*
